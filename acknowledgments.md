This document was put together by the collaborative efforts of developers, engineers, and hobbyists with the sole purpose of assisting manufacturers produce embedded devices with security in mind. A special "thank you" is due to all those who have contributed as well as those who continue to see this project evolve. It is our goal that this document will provide a detailed technical pathway for manufacturers to build secure devices for an increasingly insecure world. This is considered a "living" document as it is open to feedback and further collaboration, please contact the project leaders with any feedback you may have.
